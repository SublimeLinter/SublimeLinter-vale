# SublimeLinter-vale

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/admhlt/SublimeLinter-vale.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/admhlt/SublimeLinter-vale)

This linter plugin for [SublimeLinter](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org) provides an interface to [Vale](https://vale.sh/). It will be used with files that have the `Plain text` or `Markdown` syntaxes.

## Installation

SublimeLinter 3 must be installed in order to use this plugin. If SublimeLinter 3 is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).

### Linter installation

Before using this plugin, you must ensure that `vale` is installed on your system.

**Note**: This plugin requires `vale` **0.5.0** or later.

#### Windows

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/ValeLint/vale/releases) and download and install the latest `.msi` installer for Vale.

#### macOS

You can install Vale using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew tap ValeLint/vale
brew install vale
```

#### Linux

You can install Vale using [snap](https://snapcraft.io):

```
snap install vale
```

### Linter configuration

In order for `vale` to be executed by SublimeLinter, you must ensure that its path is available to SublimeLinter. Before going any further, please read and follow the steps in "[Finding a linter executable](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#finding-a-linter-executable)" through "Validating your PATH" in the documentation.

Once you have installed and configured `vale`, you can proceed to install the SublimeLinter-vale plugin if it is not yet installed.

### Plugin installation

Please use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) to install the linter plugin. This will ensure that the plugin will be updated when new versions are available.

To install this package with Package Control, do the following:

1.  Within Sublime Text, bring up the [Command Palette](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/sublime-text-3/extensibility/command_palette.html) and type `install`. Among the commands you should see `Package Control: Install Package`. If that command is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it. There will be a pause of a few seconds while Package Control fetches the list of available plugins.

2.  When the plugin list appears, type `vale`. Among the entries you should see `SublimeLinter-vale`. If that entry is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it.

You can configure Vale for your project using a configuration file named `.vale` or `_vale`. For more information, see [Vale's documentation](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/config/).
